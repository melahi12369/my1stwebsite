            <li>Final Fantasy 12 - I am probably one of the biggest Final Fantasy fans you know... Final Fantasy 12 was a great addition to the series, great music, great battles, and a great amount of content!</li>

            <li>Kingdom Hearts Series - This series is one to check out if you think Final Fantasy and Disney go together. Don't let that fool you, check this classic out for yourself!</li>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTPcgymUVq_Bw6deeeGbqHVldvJ6WeGD01D7Q&usqp=CAU">
            <li>Okami - The last on the list, but far from "worst." If you can't tell by now by this pick, I love Japanese culture. Don't call me a weeb!</li>
